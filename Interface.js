//TASK 1
interface heroInterface{    //normally I would creat a seperate file for the interface.

    weakness:string;

  //interface can only be used on typescript files. Not sure what typescript is
  //I love this because I just found out that I cannot implement interfaces on javascript so I would have to use typescript instead. Though I found this assessment challenging I have learned so much mingling through each and every step. They are all connected and not as hard as on may think once they get the hang of it. 
  //I am still going to keep my code because in the directions it does not say we need typescript. I have downloaded a lot of new programs on my laptop and I do not want to download anything that is not in the directions so I will not mess anything up. Please keep in mind this is all very new to me. 
  
  //Task 2
{       
    function myFunction(quest){
        return quest;
    }
    //I created a function to call and return the quest so when the user calls for it. It will return with the description.
    //I think I am missing something. Something where I can give the description and it will call it.
    //I might have to do another array for the quest as well.
}

  //TASK 3
     //Task 3 confused me because I am not sure if we are simply updating the quest. Or show that the quest has been updated. If that makes sense
     //Coding wise I would not know how to show that. Unless I just update the quest but not showing that it has been updated.

  //TASK 4   
    //Same thing with task 4 as in task 3. Are we deleting the quest. Or showing that the quest has been deleted.
    //I'm not sure how to display this unfortunately.
    //I would appreciate to ask one of the developers to show me how this can be done.
